# high-quality-permutations
high-quality program in your preferred language to output all possible permutations of a given input string. 
Your program must not use recursion, it must implement an iterative approach to Ô¨Ånd all permutations of the string. 
You are not allowed to use any special string libraries as you are allowed to only use default string operations such as concatenation and substring operations.
implementation uses ArrayList to store the partially generated permutations and then use those partial permutations to generate the final permutations in 
further iterations.
